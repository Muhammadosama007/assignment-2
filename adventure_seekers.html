            <p>Everyone likes to save money when they travel. People also appreciate learning about events and services
                that they might not be familiar with. As a travel agent, you can offer more value by connecting your
                customers with local tours, city passes, favorable rates on car rentals, transfer services, and other
                benefits.

                The more you can customize offers to the needs of your customers and seek unique services offered in
                different areas, the better. For example, in large cities with metro systems, travelers often like to
                get day or week public transportation passes. If there are popular museums, amusement parks, or other
                attractions see if you can arrange for discounted tickets.

                Integrating with GDS systems makes it easy to locate such deals for your customers. You can also connect
                with local tour groups and business owners to provide your customers with deals and discounts.</p>
